SURFEX scientific documentation

The scidoc project aims at gathering the SURFEX sofware scientific documentation.\
The project is organized in 2 subdirectories, the first named "src" contains the LaTeX sources of the main program (surfex_scidox.tex) and each chapter, the bibliography and style files and a bash compilation program. The second directory named "fig" contains the illustrations of the documentation. Once developers have fork the repository, they can compile the current version of the documentation by running compile_scidoc.bash.\

  abstract = {The Ob river in Western Siberia is one of the largest rivers in the
	Arctic and has a complex hydrological cycle mainly driven by snow
	melting in spring and rainfall and evapotranspiration in summer/autumn.
	The Ob is a source of fresh water for the Arctic Ocean and a change
	in its regime could affect the ocean thermohaline circulation. Due
	to the scarcity of in situ measurements in the Arctic and the size
	of the region, the hydrological modelling of large Arctic rivers
	is difficult to perform. To model the northern part of the Ob river
	basin, the land surface scheme ISBA (Interactions between Soil-Biosphere-Atmosphere)
	has been coupled with the flood inundation model LISFLOOD-FP. Different
	sensitivity tests on input data and parameters have been performed
	and the results have been compared with in situ measurements and
	remotely sensed observations of water level. The best modelling is
	obtained with a river depth of 10 m and a Manning coefficient of
	0.015: correlation and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients with in situ measurement
	are equal or even slightly above (depending on the precipitation
	dataset used) 0.99 and 0.95 respectively. The sensitivity tests show
	that modelling errors are mainly linked with atmospheric input (snow
	and rain precipitation), snow cover and drainage parameterization
	for ISBA and Manning coefficient, river depth and floodplain topography
	for LISFLOOD-FP. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The hydrological cycle for high latitude regions is inherently linked
	with the seasonal snowpack. Thus, accurately monitoring the snow
	depth and the associated aerial coverage are critical issues for
	monitoring the global climate system. Passive microwave satellite
	measurements provide an optimal means to monitor the snowpack over
	the arctic region. While the temporal evolution of snow extent can
	be observed globally from microwave radiometers, the determination
	of the corresponding snow depth is more difficult. A dynamic algorithm
	that accounts for the dependence of the microwave scattering on the
	snow grain size has been developed to estimate snow depth from Special
	Sensor Microwave/ Imager (SSM/I) brightness temperatures and was
	validated over the U.S. Great Plains and Western Siberia. The purpose
	of this study is to assess the dynamic algorithm performance over
	the entire high latitude (land) region by computing a snow depth
	multi-year field for the time period 1987-1995. This multi-year average
	is compared to the Global Soil Wetness Project-Phase2 (GSWP2) snow
	depth computed from several state-of-the-art land surface schemes
	and averaged over the same time period. The multi-year average obtained
	by the dynamic algorithm is in good agreement with the GSWP2 snow
	depth field (the correlation coefficient for January is 0.55). The
	static algorithm, which assumes a constant snow grain size in space
	and time does not correlate with the GSWP2 snow depth field (the
	correlation coefficient with GSWP2 data for January is -0.03), but
	exhibits a very high anti-correlation with the NCEP average January
	air temperature field (correlation coefficient -0.77), the deepest
	satellite snow pack being located in the coldest regions, where the
	snow grain size may be significantly larger than the average value
	used in the static algorithm. The dynamic algorithm performs better
	over Eurasia (with a correlation coefficient with GSWP2 snow depth
	equal to 0.65) than over North America (where the correlation coefficient
	decreases to 0.29). (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	The soil water content between the base of the root zone and the

	high-resolution soil water transfer model and then is related to

	It is shown that the use of a calibrated coefficient gives better
	results, in general, than a direct solution method when using similar
	model geometry with the same number of layers. In the initial two-layer
	version of ISBA, it was not possible to distinguish the root zone
	and subroot zone soil water reservoirs. With the three-layer version,
	the deep soil layer may provide water to the system through capillary
	rises only, and the available water content (for transpiration) is
	clearly defined. Three test cases are examined in which atmospheric
	forcing, a good description of the soil properties and vegetation
	cover, and measured soil moisture profile data are present for an
	annual cycle. Use df the three-layer version of ISBA gives general
	improvement in modeling results, and values for key parameters that
	relate evapotranspiration to soil moisture are more consistent with
	those inferred from observations, compared with the two-layer version.},

	available for hydrological modeling: the baseline force-restore approach,
	which uses a composite snow-soil-vegetation energy budget and a single
	snow layer; and a multilayer detailed internal-process snow model.
	Only the force-restore method is routinely used in atmospheric modeling

	the scheme is computationally expensive, and it is not currently

	reasons, a third new intermediate-complexity scheme has been developed
	that includes certain key physical processes from the complex model
	for improved snowpack realism and hydrological depiction while attemping
	to keep computational requirements similar to those of the simple
	default scheme. In the current study, the new scheme is described,
	evaluated, and compared with the results from the two other schemes
	at a local scale at an alpine site located within the Rhone basin
	for two contrasting (weather) years. All schemes are able to model
	the basic features of the snow cover with similar errors averaged
	over the 2-yr period; however, there are important differences on
	shorter timescales. When compared with the more complex scheme, it
	was found that differing surface energy budget parameterizations
	(turbulent transfer, albedo) were the cause for the largest differences
	in total snowpack snow water equivalent (SWE) simulated by the models.
	When compared with the simple scheme, the ability for the intermediate
	model to simulate snow ripening resulted in the largest differences
	in simulated SWE and snow temperature during melt and runoff.},

	project is an initiative within the Global Energy and Water Cycle
	Experiment (GEWEX)/Global Land - Atmosphere System Study ( GLASS)
	panel of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). It is a intermediate
	step leading up to the next phase of the Global Soil Wetness Project
	(GSWP) ( Phase 2), for which there will be a broader investigation
	of the aggregation between global scales (GSWP-1) and the river scale.
	This project makes use of the Rhone modeling system, which was developed
	in recent years by the French research community in order to study
	the continental water cycle on a regional scale. The main goals of
	this study are to investigate how 15 LSSs simulate the water balance
	for several annual cycles compared to data from a dense observation
	network consisting of daily discharge from over 145 gauges and daily
	snow depth from 24 sites, and to examine the impact of changing the
	spatial scale on the simulations. The overall evapotranspiration,
	runoff, and monthly change in water storage are similarly simulated
	by the LSSs, however, the differing partitioning among the fluxes
	results in very different river discharges and soil moisture equilibrium
	states. Subgrid runoff is especially important for discharge at the
	daily timescale and for smaller-scale basins. Also, models using
	an explicit treatment of the snowpack compared better with the observations
	than simpler composite schemes. Results from a series of scaling
	experiments are examined for which the spatial resolution of the
	computational grid is decreased to be consistent with large-scale
	atmospheric models. The impact of upscaling on the domain-averaged
	hydrological components is similar among most LSSs, with increased
	evaporation of water intercepted by the canopy and a decrease in
	surface runoff representing the most consistent inter-LSS responses.
	A significant finding is that the snow water equivalent is greatly
	reduced by upscaling in all LSSs but one that explicitly accounts
	for subgrid-scale orography effects on the atmospheric forcing.},

	an AROME ensemble of forecasts run in spin-up mode(ENS_SU). On the
	one hand, ENS_SU appears to be a reasonable approximation of ENS_DA
	compared with ALADIN-France covariances, by representing a large
	part of the small-scale variance increase. On the other hand, ENS_DA
	allows for a fully cycled development of small-scale forecast perturbations,
	which leads to a further enhancement of small-scale covariances.
	This aspect is shown to be beneficial in terms of assimilation diagnostics
	and forecast performance and in a case study. Copyright (c) 2011

  abstract = {<P>Leaf based models of net photosynthesis (A<sub>n</sub>) and stomatal
	conductance (g) are often components of whole plant, canopy and regional
	models of net primary productivity and surface energy balance. Since
	C<sub>4</sub> metabolism shows unique responses to environmental
	conditions and C<sub>4</sub> species are important agriculturally
	and ecologically, a realistic and accurate leaf model specific to
	C<sub>4</sub> plants is needed. In this paper we develop a simple
	model for predicting A<sub>n</sub> and g from leaves of C<sub>4</sub>
	plants that is easily parameterised and that predicts many of the
	important environmental responses. <P></P> We derive the leaf model
	from a simple biochemical-intercellular transport model of C<sub>4</sub>
	photosynthesis that includes inorganic carbon fixation by PEP carboxylase,
	light dependent generation of PEP and RuBP, rubisco reaction kinetics,
	and the diffusion of inorganic carbon and O<sub>2</sub> between the
	bundle sheath and mesophyll. We argue that under most conditions
	these processes can be described simply as three potentially limiting
	steps. The leaf photosynthesis model treats A<sub>n</sub> as first
	order with respect to either light, CO<sub>2</sub> or the amount
	of rubisco present and produces a continuous transition between limitations.
	The independent variables of the leaf photosynthesis model are leaf
	temperature (T<sub>I</sub>), intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> levels
	and the absorbed quantum flux. <P></P> A simple linear model of g
	in terms of A<sub>n</sub> and leaf surface CO<sub>2</sub> level (p<sub>s</sub>)
	and relative humidity (h<sub>s</sub>) is combined with the photosynthesis
	model to give leaf photosynthesis as a function of absorbed quantum
	flux, T<sub>1</sub> and p<sub>s</sub> and h<sub>s</sub> levels. <P></P>
	Gas exchange measurements from corn leaves exposed to varied light,
	CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature levels are used to parameterise and
	test the models. Model parameters are determined by fitting the models
	to a set of 21 measurements. The behaviour of the models is compared
	with an independent set of 71 measurements, and the predictions are
	shown to be highly correlated with the data. <P></P> Under most conditions
	the leaf model can be parameterised simply by determining the level
	of rubisco in the leaves. The effects of light environment, nutritional
	status and water stress levels on A<sub>n</sub> and g can be accounted
	for by appropriate adjustment of the capacity for rubisco to fix
	CO<sub>2</sub>. We estimate rubsico capacity from CO<sub>2</sub>
	and light saturated photosynthesis although leaf nitrogen content
	or rubisco assays from leaf extracts could also be used for this
	purpose.</P>},

  abstract = {Over recent years, many numerical studies have suggested that the
	land surface hydrology contributes to atmospheric variability and
	predictability on a wide range of scales. Conversely, land surface
	models (LSMs) have been also used to study the hydrological impacts
	of seasonal climate anomalies and of global warming. Validating these
	models at the global scale is therefore a crucial task, which requires
	off-line simulations driven by realistic atmospheric fluxes to avoid
	the systematic biases commonly found in the atmospheric models. The
	present study is aimed at validating a new land surface hydrology
	within the ISBA LSM. Global simulations are conducted at a 1 degrees
	by 1 degrees horizontal resolution using 3-hourly atmospheric forcings
	provided by the Global Soil Wetness Project. Compared to the original
	scheme, the new hydrology includes a comprehensive and consistent
	set of sub-grid parametrizations in order to account for spatial
	heterogeneities of topography, vegetation, and precipitation within
	each grid cell. The simulated runoff is converted into river discharge
	using the total runoff integrating pathways (TRIP) river routing
	model (RRM), and compared with available monthly observations at
	80 gauging stations distributed over the world's largest river basins.
	The simulated discharges are also compared with parallel global simulations
	from five alternative LSMs. Globally, the new sub-grid hydrology
	performs better than the original ISBA scheme. Nevertheless, the

  abstract = {In atmospheric models, the partitioning of precipitation between infiltration
	and runoff has a major influence on the terrestrial water budget,
	and thereby on the simulated weather or climate. River routing models
	are now available to convert the simulated runoff into river discharge,
	offering a good opportunity to validate land surface models at the
	regional scale. However, given the low resolution of global atmospheric
	models, the quality of the hydrological simulations is much dependent
	on various processes occurring on unresolved spatial scales. This
	paper focuses on the parameterization of sub-grid hydrological processes
	within the ISBA land surface model. Five off-line simulations are
	performed over the French Rhone river basin, including various sets
	of parameterizations related to the sub-grid variability of topography,
	precipitation, maximum infiltration capacity and land surface properties.
	Parallel experiments are conducted at a high (8 km by 8 km) and low
	(1 degrees by 1 degrees) resolution, in order to test the robustness
	of the simulated water budget. Additional simulations are performed
	using the whole package of sub-grid parameterizations plus an exponential
	profile with depth of saturated hydraulic conductivity, in order
	to investigate the interaction between the vertical soil physics
	and the horizontal heterogeneities. All simulations are validated
	against a dense network of gauging measurements, after the simulated
	runoff is converted into discharge using the MODCOU river routing
	model. Generally speaking, the new version of ISBA, with both the
	sub-grid hydrology and the modified hydraulic conductivity, shows
	a better simulation of river discharge, as well as a weaker sensitivity
	to model resolution. The positive impact of each individual sub-grid
	parameterization on the simulated discharges is more obvious at the
	low resolution, whereas the high-resolution simulations are more
	sensitive to the exponential profile with depth of saturated hydraulic
	conductivity.},

	It also provides a unique opportunity to develop and test land surface

	simulations that are not affected by the systematic errors found
	in atmospheric models. Nevertheless, the accuracy and reliability
	of the 10-year GSWP-2 atmospheric forcing remain questionable. A
	first comparison using the high-resolution Rhone-AGGregation (Rhone-AGG)
	database reveals that the baseline GSWP-2 precipitation forcing is
	drastically overestimated over the Rhone river basin. Hydrological
	simulations driven with each dataset and using the ISBA land surface
	model and the MODCOU river routing model are also compared. The simulated
	river discharges are validated against a dense network of river gauges
	and are generally less realistic when using the GSWP-2 instead of
	the Rhone-AGG precipitation forcing. Secondly, the GSWP-2 precipitation
	forcing is compared with three alternative data sets (GPCP-2, CRU-2,
	CMAP) at the global scale. Moreover, the results of a global sensitivity
	study to the precipitation forcing conducted with six land surface
	models are shown. The TRIP river routing model is used to convert
	daily runoff from all models into river discharges, which are compared
	at 80 gauging stations distributed over the globe. In agreement with
	the regional evaluation, the results reveal that the baseline GSWP-2
	precipitation forcing is generally overestimated over the mid and
	high latitudes, which implies systematic errors in the simulated
	discharges. This study reveals that the empirical wind corrections
	applied to the GSWP-2 precipitation forcing are exaggerated, whereas
	the GPCP satellite adjustments seem to be useful for simulating realistic
	annual mean river discharges over the East Siberian river basins.},

	often leads to unrealistic model soil moisture. Consequently, several
	NWP centers are moving toward also assimilating remotely sensed near-surface
	soil moisture observations. Within this context, an EKF is used to
	compare the assimilation of screen-level observations and near-surface
	soil moisture data from AMSR-E into the ISBA land surface model over
	July 2006. Several issues regarding the use of each data type are
	exposed, and the potential to use the AMSR-E data, either in place
	of or together with the screen-level data, is examined. When the
	two data types are assimilated separately, there is little agreement
	between the root zone soil moisture updates generated by each, indicating
	that for this experiment the AMSR-E data could not have replaced
	the screen-level data to obtain similar surface turbulent fluxes.
	For the screen-level variables, there is a persistent diurnal cycle
	in the model-observations bias, which is not related to soil moisture.
	The resulting diurnal cycle in the analysis increments demonstrates
	how assimilating screen-level observations can lead to unrealistic
	soil moisture updates, reinforcing the need to assimilate alternative
	data sets. However, when the two data types are assimilated together,
	the near-surface soil moisture provides a much weaker constraint
	of the root zone soil moisture than the screen-level observations
	do, and the inclusion of the AMSR-E data does not substantially change
	the results compared to the assimilation of screen-level variables
	alone.},

  abstract = {[1] Within the framework of the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment
	(GEWEX)/ Rhone project, a system has been built to estimate the hydrological
	budget of the Rhone, one of the major European rivers (with a 86,500
	km(2) surface area for the French part of the catchment). The methodology
	is based on three models, one for each component of the hydrometeorological
	system: The atmospheric parameter analysis, the snow cover, the surface
	water and energy budget, and the underground water transfer and discharge
	estimation. This tool has been validated for 14 years (from 1981
	to 1994) by comparing the daily river flows simulated by the models
	with measurements from 145 gauging stations. In this study, the results
	of the ARPEGE-Climat general circulation model (GCM) have been used
	to estimate the climate of the Rhone catchment in 60 years. The perturbation
	of the air temperature and precipitation amount has been used to
	modify the actual set of meteorological parameters in order to simulate
	the hydrological budget of the Rhone river. Vegetation and soil structure
	are supposed to be identical to current values, which is a strong
	hypothesis. The river discharge and soil water resources under the
	climatic scenario are compared with the results of the actual simulation.
	Strong contrasts in the hydrological response of the catchment are
	noticeable, depending on the location of the subcatchments and the
	amount of precipitation. Snow cover is the most sensitive hydrological
	component to the air temperature increase, and the high mountainous
	river regimes are strongly modified. When considering the soil water
	content, it appears that the northern part of the domain stays quite
	wet, whereas drying is enhanced in the south. The uncertainties in
	the results are estimated by analyzing the model sensitivity to different
	simple climatic scenarios. In particular, the analysis brings into
	light the impact of the downscaling of the GCM results.},

In particular, the factors limiting photosynthesis under these conditions, and their possible interactions with other environmental conditions, are unknown. To assess these issues, changes of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation (AN) and its underlying limitations were followed during prolonged water stress and subsequent re-watering in tobacco (Nicotiana sylvestris) plants growing under three different climatic conditions: outdoors in summer, outdoors in spring, and indoors in a growth chamber. In particular, the regulation of stomatal conductance (gs), mesophyll conductance to CO2 (gm), leaf photochemistry (chlorophyll fluorescence), and biochemistry (Vc,max) were assessed. Leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence data revealed that water stress induced a similar degree of stomatal closure and decreased AN under all three conditions, while Vc,max was unaffected. However, the behaviour of gm differed depending on the climatic conditions. In outdoor plants, gm strongly declined with water stress, but it recovered rapidly (1â2âd) after re-watering in spring while it remained low many days after re-watering in summer. In indoor plants, gm initially declined with water stress, but then recovered to control values during the acclimation period. These differences were reflected in different velocities of recovery of AN after re-watering, being the slowest in outdoor summer plants and the fastest in indoor plants. It is suggested that these differences among the experiments are related to the prevailing climatic conditions, i.e. to the fact that stress factors other than water stress have been superimposed (e.g. excessive light and elevated temperature). In conclusion, besides gs, gm contributes greatly to the limitation of photosynthesis during water stress and during recovery from water stress, but its role is strongly dependent on the impact of additional environmental factors.}

  abstract = {A simple eddy kinetic energy parameterization of the oceanic vertical
	mixing is presented. The parameterization scheme is based on recent
	works on atmospheric turbulence modeling. It is designed to simulate
	vertical mixing at all depths, from the upper boundary layer down
	to the abyss. This scheme includes a single prognostic equation for
	the turbulent kinetic energy. The computation of the turbulent length
	scales is diagnostic, rather than prognostic. In weakly turbulent
	regions the simulated vertical diffusivity is inversely proportional
	to the Brunt-Vaïsala frequency. In the first validation experiments
	presented here, the vertical mixing scheme is embedded into a simple
	one-dimensional model and used for upper ocean simulations at two
	very different test sites: the station Papa in the Gulf of Alaska
	and the Long-Term Upper Ocean Study (LOTUS) mooring in the Sargasso
	Sea. At station Papa the model successfully simulates the seasonal
	evolution of the upper ocean temperature field. At LOTUS the focus
	is on a short 2-week period. A detailed analysis of the oceanic heat
	budget during that period reveals a large bias in the bulk-derived
	surface heat fluxes. After correction of the fluxes the model does
	well in simulating the evolution of the temperature and wind-driven
	current. In particular, the large observed diurnal cycles of the
	sea surface temperature are well reproduced. During the second (windy)
	week of the selected period the model accounts for about two thirds
	of the kinetic energy of the observed upper ocean currents at periods
	larger than 6 hours. The local wind forcing thus appears to be the
	dominant generation mechanism for the near-inertial motions, which
	are the most energetic. The velocity simulation is especially good
	at the low frequencies. During the second simulated week the model
	accounts for as much as 78% of the kinetic energy at subinertial
	frequencies. The simulated mean velocity profile is reminiscent of
	an Ekman spiral, in agreement with the observations.},

  abstract = {[1] The land surface model (LSM) ISBA- A- gs ( Interactions between
	Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere, CO(2)-reactive) is specifically designed
	to simulate leaf stomatal conductance and leaf area index (LAI) in
	response to climate, soil properties, and atmospheric carbon dioxide
	concentration. The model is run at the global scale, forced by the
	GSWP-2 meteorological data at a resolution of 1 degrees for the period
	of 1986 - 1995. We test the model by comparing the simulated LAI
	values against three satellite-derived data sets (ISLSCP Initiative
	II data, MODIS data and ECOCLIMAP data) and find that the model reproduces
	the major patterns of spatial and temporal variability in global
	vegetation. As a result, the mean of the maximum annual LAI estimates
	of the model falls within the range of the various satellite data
	sets. Despite no explicit representation of phenology, the model
	captures the seasonal cycle in LAI well and shows realistic variations
	in start of the growing season as a function of latitude. The interannual
	variability is also well reported for numerous regions of the world,
	particularly where precipitation controls photosynthesis. The comparison
	also reveals that some processes need to be improved or introduced
	in the model, in particular the snow dynamics and the treatment of
	vegetation in cultivated areas, respectively. The overall comparisons
	demonstrate the potential of ISBA-A-gs model to simulate LAI in a
	realistic fashion at the global scale.},

  abstract = {Several studies have shown the importance of aerosols in the Earth's
	radiative balance. The radiative effect of dust has earlier been
	quantified in global and regional climate models. Fewer studies have
	included prediction of aerosols online in numerical weather prediction
	(NWP) models. Predicting climate effect of aerosols is different
	from including aerosols actively in weather prediction because climate
	models give average responses over long timescales, whereas the purpose
	of weather prediction models is to calculate the right weather on
	short timescales. In this paper, we run a mesoscale NWP with four
	different assumptions on dust aerosols: (1) no dust, (2) climatological
	data set for dust aerosols, (3) forecasted dust using the Dust Entrainment
	and Deposition model (DEAD) and (4) same as assumption 3 but with
	decreased single scattering albedo. We show that the assumption on
	dust is important for predicting ground temperature and convective
	precipitation in the model. Dust changes the model physics through
	changing the radiative fluxes. We interpret the changes through analyzing
	the energy budgets for four zones close to the major dust sources.
	The zones include both convective and nonconvective areas. In convective
	areas over ocean, dust can decrease convective activity. The vertical
	gradient of the aerosols and their single scattering albedo determine
	how efficient they are. Over land, dust also influences the surface
	energy budget so that decreased latent heat fluxes result if dust
	plumes pass over areas where water evaporates from the surface.},

	endorheic regions, such as most of the Sahel, where little useful
	information can be derived from river flow measurements and basin
	water budgets. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)
	satellite mission provides an accurate measurement of the terrestrial
	gravity field variations from which land water storage variations
	can be derived. However, their retrieval is not straightforward,
	and different methods are employed, which results in different water
	storage GRACE products. On the other hand, water storage can be estimated
	by land surface modeling forced with observed or satellite-based
	boundary conditions, but such estimates can be highly model dependent.
	In this study, land water storage by six GRACE products and soil
	moisture estimations by nine land surface models (run within the
	framework of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis Land
	Surface Intercomparison Project (ALMIP)) are evaluated over West
	Africa, with a particular focus on the Sahelian area. The water storage
	spatial distribution, including zonal transects, its seasonal cycle,
	and its and interannual variability, are analyzed for the years 2003-2007.
	Despite the nonnegligible differences among the various GRACE products
	and among the different models, a generally good agreement between
	satellite and model estimates is found over the West Africa study
	region. In particular, GRACE data are shown to reproduce well the
	water storage interannual variability over the Sahel for the 5 year
	study period. The comparison between satellite estimates and ALMIP
	results leads to the identification of processes needing improvement
	in the land surface models. In particular, our results point out
	the importance of correctly simulating slow water reservoirs as well
	as evapotranspiration during the dry season for accurate soil moisture
	modeling over West Africa.},

	fluxes of a variety of trace gas species. We have developed a global
	model to estimate emissions of volatile organic compounds from natural
	sources (NVOC). Methane is not considered here and has been reviewed
	in detail elsewhere. The model has a highly resolved spatial grid
	(0.5° × 0.5° latitude/longitude) and generates hourly average emission
	estimates. Chemical species are grouped into four categories: isoprene,
	monoterpenes, other reactive VOC (ORVOC), and other VOC (OVOC). NVOC
	emissions from oceans are estimated as a function of geophysical
	variables from a general circulation model and ocean color satellite
	data. Emissions from plant foliage are estimated from ecosystem specific
	biomass and emission factors and algorithms describing light and
	temperature dependence of NVOC emissions. Foliar density estimates
	are based on climatic variables and satellite data. Temporal variations
	in the model are driven by monthly estimates of biomass and temperature
	and hourly light estimates. The annual global VOC flux is estimated
	to be 1150 Tg C, composed of 44% isoprene, 11% monoterpenes, 22.5%
	other reactive VOC, and 22.5% other VOC. Large uncertainties exist
	for each of these estimates and particularly for compounds other
	than isoprene and monoterpenes. Tropical woodlands (rain forest,
	seasonal, drought-deciduous, and savanna) contribute about half of
	all global natural VOC emissions. Croplands, shrublands and other
	woodlands contribute 10&#8211;20% apiece. Isoprene emissions calculated
	for temperate regions are as much as a factor of 5 higher than previous
	estimates.},

  abstract = {[1] The hydrometeorological model SIM consists of a meteorological
	analysis system ( SAFRAN), a land surface model (ISBA), and a hydrogeological
	model ( MODCOU). It generates atmospheric forcing at an hourly time
	step, and it computes water and surface energy budgets, the river
	flow at more than 900 river-gauging stations, and the level of several
	aquifers. SIM was extended over all of France in order to have a
	homogeneous nationwide monitoring of the water resources: it can
	therefore be used to forecast flood risk and to monitor drought risk
	over the entire nation. The hydrometeorological model was applied
	over a 10-year period from 1995 to 2005. In this paper the databases
	used by the SIM model are presented; then the 10-year simulation
	is assessed by using the observations of daily streamflow, piezometric
	head, and snow depth. This assessment shows that SIM is able to reproduce
	the spatial and temporal variabilities of the water fluxes. The efficiency
	is above 0.55 ( reasonable results) for 66% of the simulated river
	gauges, and above 0.65 ( rather good results) for 36% of them. However,
	the SIM system produces worse results during the driest years, which
	is more likely due to the fact that only few aquifers are simulated
	explicitly. The annual evolution of the snow depth is well reproduced,
	with a square correlation coefficient around 0.9 over the large altitude
	range in the domain. The streamflow observations were used to estimate
	the overall error of the simulated latent heat flux, which was estimated
	to be less than 4%.},

  abstract = {The paper describes the implementation of a macroscale hydrological
	model in the Rhone river basin. The hydrological model is coupled
	with a soil vegetation - atmosphere transfer scheme in order to resolve
	the daily cycle of the surface energy balance and the water budget.
	The water surface routing and the water table evolution are computed
	in the hydrological model with a daily time step. First, the important
	database collected in the Rhone basin on soil, vegetation, hydrological
	regimes, and atmospheric variables is briefly described. The coupled
	model is forced by observed atmospheric quantities during 1 year.
	The simulation results are discussed with respect to stream flows,
	soil water content, runoff, and surface fluxes. The simulation clearly
	shows the importance of topography and snow on the hydrological regime
	of the Rhone and its tributaries. The simulated spatial variability
	of evaporation and total runoff are very large within the basin.
	Small annual evaporation and large runoff are found in the Alps because
	of the snow processes. On the other hand, the areas experiencing
	Mediterranean climate conditions (large annual global radiation,
	low precipitation) are characterized by negligible annual runoff.
	The simulation is used as a reference to test aggregation methods
	accounting for the subgrid variability of surface processes within
	a large area (128 km by 128 km). It is shown that the aggregated
	surface fluxes, drainage and runoff can be computed with an error
	lower than 5%, provided that the subgrid variability of precipitation,
	runoff, and vegetation is taken into account. If these subgrid processes
	are not aggregated, the errors in the simulation of the various terms
	of the water balance may exceed the annual reference by 20%.},

	As a result, a global dataset with the resolution of 18 was developed.
	To project lake climatology onto a particular NWP model grid, data
	are extracted from the dataset depending on the lake depth value
	provided on the target grid. To prevent drifting of the bottom temperature
	in warm deep lakes, relaxation to the long-term mean air temperature
	was applied in FLake. Lake model climatology was validated against

	As a dynamic vegetation model, it explicitly represents competitive

	It can thus be used in simulations for the study of feedbacks between
	transient climate and vegetation cover changes, but it can also be
	used with a prescribed vegetation distribution. The whole seasonal

	dates or use of satellite data. The model is coupled to the IPSL-CM4
	coupled atmosphere-ocean-vegetation model. Carbon and surface energy
	fluxes from the coupled hydrology-vegetation model compare well with

	System Model. Here, we describe a broad set of model improvements
	and additions that have been provided through the CLM development
	community to create CLM4. The model is extended with a carbon-nitrogen
	(CN) biogeochemical model that is prognostic with respect to vegetation,
	litter, and soil carbon and nitrogen states and vegetation phenology.
	An urban canyon model is added and a transient land cover and land
	use change (LCLUC) capability, including wood harvest, is introduced,
	enabling study of historic and future LCLUC on energy, water, momentum,
	carbon, and nitrogen fluxes. The hydrology scheme is modified with
	a revised numerical solution of the Richards equation and a revised
	ground evaporation parameterization that accounts for litter and
	within-canopy stability. The new snow model incorporates the SNow
	and Ice Aerosol Radiation model (SNICAR) - which includes aerosol
	deposition, grain-size dependent snow aging, and vertically-resolved
	snowpack heating; as well as new snow cover and snow burial
	fraction parameterizations. The thermal and hydrologic properties
	of organic soil are accounted for and the ground column is extended
	to ~50-m depth. Several other minor modifications to the land surface
	types dataset, grass and crop optical properties, atmospheric forcing
	height, roughness length and displacement height, and the disposition
	of snow-capped runoff are also incorporated. Taken together, these
	augmentations to CLM result in improved soil moisture dynamics, drier
	soils, and stronger soil moisture variability. The new model also
	exhibits higher snow cover, cooler soil temperatures in organic-rich
	soils, greater global river discharge, and lower albedos over forests
	and grasslands, all of which are improvements compared to CLM3.5.
	When CLM4 is run with CN, the mean biogeophysical simulation is slightly
	degraded because the vegetation structure is prognostic rather than
	prescribed, though running in this mode also allows more complex
	terrestrial interactions with climate and climate change.},

	season. For these extreme precipitating events, the Mediterranean
	Sea supplies heat and moisture to the atmospheric boundary layer
	through the turbulent heat fluxes. In turn the low-level jet, which
	frequently accompanies these events, induces a stress on the oceanic
	mixed layer. The aim of this study is to examine the sensitivity
	of short-range (24 h) high-resolution (2&#8211;3 km) forecasts to
	the sea surface fluxes parameterization for three representative
	torrential rainfall events. We consider in particular two sea surface
	fluxes bulk parameterizations: the original MESO-NH model parameterization
	based on the Louis (1979) formulation and the iterative Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere
	Response Experiment (COARE) bulk algorithm from Fairall et al. (2003).
	Results show that the two parameterizations produce very different
	air-sea fluxes values, especially for strong winds; the largest differences
	are therefore found under the low-level jets, where the COARE parameterization
	reduces the wind stress and the latent heat flux. The evaporation
	reduction results in a decrease of the low-level humidity transport
	over the Mediterranean Sea in every case studied so that the convective
	activity, still intense, results in lower rainfall amounts. The impact
	of surface fluxes parameterization on the ocean mixed layer modeling
	is also examined by driving a one-dimensional ocean model with the
	same set of atmospheric parameters but using the two parameterizations.
	Results show a significant impact on the mixed layer depth.},

	energy and water exchanges between urban surfaces and the atmosphere
	by treating the urban area as a series of urban canyons, coupled
	to the Interactions between Soil, Biosphere, and Atmosphere (ISBA)
	scheme, was run in offline mode for Marseille, France. TEB's performance
	is evaluated with observations of surface temperatures and surface
	energy balance fluxes collected during the field experiments to constrain
	models of atmospheric pollution and transport of emissions (ESCOMPTE)-urban
	boundary layer (UBL) campaign. Particular attention was directed
	to the influence of different surface databases, used for input parameters,
	on model predictions. Comparison of simulated canyon temperatures
	with observations resulted in improvements to TEB parameterizations
	by increasing the ventilation. Evaluation of the model with wall,
	road, and roof surface temperatures gave good results. The model
	succeeds in simulating a sensible heat flux larger than heat storage,
	as observed. A sensitivity comparison using generic dense city parameters,
	derived from the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE)
	land cover database, and those from a surface database developed
	specifically for the Marseille city center shows the importance of
	correctly documenting the urban surface. Overall, the TEB scheme
	is shown to be fairly robust, consistent with results from previous

	phase 2(d) experiment at Valdai, Russia, offers a unique opportunity
	to evaluate land surface schemes, especially snow and frozen soil
	parameterizations. Here, the ability of the 21 schemes that participated
	in the experiment to correctly simulate the thermal and hydrological
	properties of the soil on several different timescales was examined.
	Using observed vertical profiles of soil temperature and soil moisture,
	the impact of frozen soil schemes in the land surface models on the
	soil temperature and soil moisture simulations was evaluated. It
	was found that when soil-water freezing is explicitly included in
	a model, it improves the simulation of soil temperature and its variability
	at seasonal and interannual scales. Although change of thermal conductivity
	of the soil also affects soil temperature simulation, this effect
	is rather weak. The impact of frozen soil on soil moisture is inconclusive
	in this experiment due to the particular climate at Valdai, where
	the top 1 m of soil is very close to saturation during winter and
	the range for soil moisture changes at the time of snowmelt is very
	limited. The results also imply that inclusion of explicit snow processes
	in the models would contribute to substantially improved simulations.
	More sophisticated snow models based on snow physics tend to produce

  abstract = {Two analysis schemes are developed within an off-line version of the
	land surface scheme ISBA for the initialization of soil water content
	and temperature in numerical weather prediction models. The first
	soil analysis is based on optimal interpolation that is currently
	operational in a number of weather centers. The second soil analysis
	is an extended Kalman filter (EKF) which will allow the assimilation
	of satellite observations. First, it is shown, by comparing the Kalman
	gain of both analysis schemes, that it is possible to assimilate
	screen level temperature and relative humidity in an off-line system.
	This is of great interest for future combined assimilations of conventional
	and satellite data. The reduced computing time in running the land
	surface scheme outside the atmospheric model makes Kalman filter
	approaches compatible with operational requirements. The methodology
	for coupling the land surface data assimilation with the atmospheric
	analysis system is explained in order to highlight the existing feedbacks
	between the two systems (in comparison to fully decoupled land data
	assimilation systems). The linearity of the observation operator
	Jacobians estimated by finite differences and the relevance of the
	soil prognostic variables to be initialized are assessed. Finally,
	the two systems are compared over western Europe for the month of
	July 2006 by assimilating screen level temperature and relative humidity
	every 6 h. The EKF has been simplified by keeping the covariance
	matrix of background errors constant. The two soil analysis schemes
	behave similarly in response to screen level atmospheric errors.
	The EKF is superior in identifying situations where the near-surface
	atmosphere is sensitive to soil perturbations, which leads to better
	use of observations. Over France, the capability of both systems
	to moisten the soil when rain events are absent from the forcing
	is demonstrated.},

	devised to define effective land surface properties. Specific improvements

	percolation. The methodology used to derive climatological maps of
	land surface parameters at the grid-scale resolution of the model
	from existing databases for soil and vegetation types at global scale
	is described. A 3-yr integration for the present day climate with
	a T42L30 version of the climate model has been performed. Results
	obtained compare favorably with available observed climatologies
	related to the various components of the continental surface energy
	and water budgets. Differences are due mostly to a poor simulation
	of the precipitation field. However, some differences suggest specific
	improvements in the surface scheme concerning representation of the
	bare soil albedo, the surface runoff, and the soil moisture initialization.

  abstract = {A soil-derived dust emission scheme has been designed to provide an
	explicit representation of the desert dust sources for the atmospheric
	transport models dealing with the simulation of the desert dust cycle.
	Two major factors characterizing the erodible surface are considered:
	(1) the size distribution of the erodible loose particles of the
	soil which controls the erosion threshold and the emission strength
	and (2) the surface roughness which imposes the efficient wind friction
	velocity acting on the erodible surface. These two parameters are
	included in a formulation of the threshold wind friction velocity
	by adapting a size-dependent parameterization proposed by Iversen
	and White (1982) and by applying to the rough erodible surfaces a
	drag partition scheme derived from Arya (1975). This parameterization
	of the threshold friction velocity has been included in an horizontal
	flux equation proposed by White (1979). This allows to attribute
	a specific production rate to each soil size range for each type
	of surface. The dust flux F is then considered as a fraction of the
	total horizontal flux G, the value of the ratio F/G being imposed,
	at this time, by the soil clay content. In summary, the computed
	mass fluxes depend on the soil size distribution, the roughness lengths,
	and the wind friction velocity. The different steps of this scheme
	have been independently validated by comparison with relevant experimental
	data. Globally, the agreement is satisfying, so that the dust fluxes
	could be retrieved with less uncertainties than those observed in
	previous simulations of the desert dust cycle.},

  abstract = {An urban surface scheme for atmospheric mesoscale models is presented.
	A generalization of local canyon geometry is defined instead of the
	usual bare soil formulation currently used to represent cities in
	atmospheric models. This allows refinement of the radiative budgets
	as well as momentum, turbulent heat and ground fluxes. The scheme
	is aimed to be as general as possible, in order to represent any
	city in the world, for any time or weather condition (heat island
	cooling by night, urban wake, water evaporation after rainfall and
	snow effects). Two main parts of the scheme are validated against
	published data. Firstly, it is shown that the evolution of the model-predicted
	fluxes during a night with calm winds is satisfactory, considering
	both the longwave budget and the surface temperatures. Secondly,
	the original shortwave scheme is tested off-line and compared to
	the effective albedo of a canyon scale model. These two validations
	show that the radiative energy input to the urban surface model is
	realistic. Sensitivity tests of the model are performed for one-year
	simulation periods, for both oceanic and continental climates. The
	scheme has the ability to retrieve, without ad hoc assumptions, the
	diurnal hysteresis between the turbulent heat flux and ground heat
	flux. It reproduces the damping of the daytime turbulent heat flux
	by the heat storage flux observed in city centres. The latent heat
	flux is negligible on average, but can be large when short time scales
	are considered (especially after rainfall). It also suggests that
	in densely built areas, domestic heating can overwhelm the net radiation,
	and supply a continuous turbulent heat flux towards the atmosphere.
	This becomes very important in winter for continental climates. Finally,
	a comparison with a vegetation scheme shows that the suburban environment
	can be represented with a bare soil formulation for large temporal
	or spatial averages (typical of global climatic studies), but that
	a surface scheme dedicated to the urban surface is necessary when
	smaller scales are considered: town meteorological forecasts, mesoscale
	or local studies.},

	fluxes for urban areas. It is forced with atmospheric data and radiation
	recorded above roof level and incorporates detailed representations
	of the urban surface (canyon geometry) to simulate energy balances
	for walls, roads, and roofs. Here the authors evaluate TEB using
	directly measured surface temperatures and local-scale energy balance
	and radiation fluxes for two "simple'' urban sites: a downtown area
	within the historic core of Mexico City, Mexico (stone buildings
	five to six stories in height), and a light industrial site in Vancouver,
	British Columbia, Canada (flat-roofed, single-story warehouses).
	At both sites, vegetation cover is less than 5%, which permits direct
	evaluation of TEB in the absence of a coupled vegetation scheme.
	Following small modifications to TEB, notably to the aerodynamic
	resistance formulations, the model is shown to perform well overall.
	In Mexico City, with deep urban canyons and stone walls, almost two-thirds
	of the net radiation is partitioned into storage heat flux during
	the day, and this maintains large heat releases and an upward turbulent
	sensible heat flux at night. TEB simulates all of these features
	well. At both sites TEB correctly simulates the net radiation, surface
	temperatures, and the partitioning between the turbulent and storage
	heat fluxes. The composite wall temperature simulated by TEB is close
	to the average of the four measured wall temperatures. A sensitivity
	analysis of model parameters shows TEB is fairly robust; for the
	conditions considered here, TEB is most sensitive to roof characteristics
	and incoming solar radiation.},

	Soil-Biosphere-Atmosphere (ISBA) land surface scheme fully coupled
	with the Meso-NH mesoscale atmospheric model. The ability of the
	modeling system to correctly reproduce the screen-level variables
	as well as the boundary layer characteristics is examined for more
	than 30 clear convective days monitored during the CERES 2005 and
	2007 field campaigns. For the horizontal resolution considered (8
	km), this study shows that the boundary layer characteristics and
	the low-level variables are better simulated when the subgrid-scale
	surface process variability is simulated explicitly using the so-called
	"tiling method." An additional improvement is brought when the CO(2)
	diurnal cycle is used interactively because of the physical link
	between the stomatal conductance used both for CO(2) assimilation
	and plant transpiration. The parameterization of this link between
	CO(2) and evaporation fluxes improves the simulation of the Bowen
	ratio and therefore of the atmospheric boundary layer. The last part
	of the paper discusses the realism of the simulated regional field
	of CO(2) when the carbon configuration is activated in the mesoscale
	model. Large regional variability of CO(2) within the atmospheric
	boundary layer is found in response to the spatial and seasonal variability
	of CO(2) surface fluxes with respect to the three main land covers
	in the area: pine forest, extensive winter (wheat), and summer (maize)
	crops.},

	This scheme differs from previous schemes developed to address similar

	efficiency while representing the processes most important for our
	applications. The model is based on the original TOPMODEL-based land
	surface-atmosphere transfer scheme [Famiglietti and Wood, 1994a]
	with modifications to correct for deficiencies in the representation
	of ground heat flux, soil column geometry, soil evaporation, transpiration,
	and the effect of atmospheric stability on energy fluxes. These deficiencies
	were found to cause errors in the model predictions in quantities
	such as the sensible heat flux, to which the development of the atmospheric
	boundary layer is particularly sensitive. Application of the model
	to the entire First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology
	Project Field Experiment 1987 experimental period, focusing on Intensive
	Field Campaigns 3 and 4, shows that it successfully represents the

	climate model, sixteen land surface schemes participating in the
	Project for the Intercomparison of Land-surface Parametrization Schemes
	(PILPS) were run off-line to equilibrium using forcing data from
	a GCM representative of a tropical forest and a mid-latitude grassland
	grid point. The values for each land surface parameter (roughness
	length, minimum stomatal resistance, soil depth etc.) were provided.
	Results were quality controlled and analyzed, focusing on the scatter
	simulated amongst the models. There were large differences in how
	the models' partitioned available energy between sensible and latent
	heat. Annually averaged, simulations for the tropical forest ranged
	by 79 W m(-2) for the sensible heat flux and 80 W m(-2) for the latent
	heat flux. For the grassland, simulations ranged by 34 W m(-2) for
	the sensible heat flux and 27 W m(-2) for the latent heat flux. Similarly
	large differences were found for simulated runoff and soil moisture
	and at the monthly time scale. The models' simulation of annually
	averaged effective radiative temperature varied with a range, between
	all the models, of 1.4 K for tropical forest and 2.2 K for the grassland.
	The simulation of latent and sensible heat fluxes by a standard 'bucket'
	models was anomalous although this could be corrected by an additional
	resistance term. These results imply that the current land surface
	models do not agree on the land surface climate when the atmospheric
	forcing and surface parameters are prescribed. The nature of the
	experimental design, it being offline and with artificial forcing,
	generally precludes judgements concerning the relative quality of
	any specific model. Although these results were produced de-coupled
	from a host model, they do cast doubt on the reliability of land
	surface schemes. It is therefore a priority to resolve the disparity
	in the simulations, understand the reasons behind the scatter and
	to determine whether this lack of agreement in decoupled tests is
	reproduced in coupled experiments.},

	general circulation models (GCMs) to land surface schemes (LSS) in
	order to achieve a plug compatibility between these complex models.
	As surface parameterizations include more processes, they have moved
	from being subroutines of GCMs to independent schemes which can also
	be applied for other purposes. This evolution has raised the problem
	within climate modeling groups of coupling these schemes to GCMs
	in a simple and flexible way. As LSS reaches a larger independence,
	a general interface is needed to enable exchange within the community.
	This paper discusses the tasks LSS have to fulfill when coupled to
	a GCM after a review of the current state of the art and the likely
	future evolutions of both components. The numerical schemes used
	for the processes which couple the land surfaces to the atmosphere
	are reviewed to ensure that the interface can be applied to all LSS
	and GCMs after only minor changes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

	(AMMA) Land Surface Models Intercomparison Project (ALMIP) for Microwave
	Emission Models (ALMIP-MEM). ALMIP-MEM comprises an ensemble of simulations
	of C-band brightness temperatures over West Africa for 2006. Simulations
	have been performed for an incidence angle of 55 degrees, and results
	are evaluated against C-band satellite data from the Advanced Microwave

	encompasses 96 simulations, for 8 Land Surface Models (LSMs) coupled
	to 12 configurations of the Community Microwave Emission Model (CMEM).
	CMEM has a modular structure which permits combination of several
	parameterizations with different vegetation opacity and soil dielectric
	models. ALMIP-MEM provides the first intercomparison of state-of-theart
	land surface and microwave emission models at regional scale. Quantitative
	estimates of the relative importance of land surface modeling and
	radiative transfer modeling for the monitoring of low-frequency passive
	microwave emission on land surfaces are obtained. This is of high
	interest for the various users of coupled land surface microwave
	emission models. Results show that both LSMs and microwave model
	components strongly influence the simulated top of atmosphere (TOA)
	brightness temperatures. For most of the LSMs, the Kirdyashev opacity
	model is the most suitable to simulate TOA brightness temperature
	in best agreement with the AMSR-E data. When this best microwave
	modeling configuration is used, all the LSMs are able to reproduce
	the main temporal and spatial variability of measured brightness
	temperature. Averaged among the LSMs, correlation is 0.67 and averaged

  abstract = {[1] As the Seine basin is the most urbanized and industrialized French
	basin, with intensive crop areas, the impact of floods and low flow
	is very important. The aim of this study is to improve the understanding
	of the hydrological functioning of the Seine basin and to estimate
	the influence of the large aquifers that cover a great part of the
	domain, as well as the impact of the urbanized areas. The simulation
	is based on the SAFRAN-ISBA-MODCOU (SIM) coupled system, which includes
	the Analysis System for Providing Atmospheric Information Relevant
	to Snow ( SAFRAN) analysis of the atmospheric forcing, two surface
	schemes that take into account the urban areas ( Town Energy Budget
	(TEB)) and the natural areas ( Interactions Soil-Biosphere-Atmosphere
	(ISBA)), and the distributed hydrological model Coupled Model (MODCOU).
	A 17-year simulation was performed and validated against the observations
	of about 100 river gauges and 130 piezometric stations. The simulated
	streamflows are comparable with the observations, especially for
	large river stations of the Seine and its main tributaries. The spatial
	and temporal variations of the aquifer levels simulated by MODCOU
	are also comparable to the observed piezometric data, although the
	local comparison can present differences. The impact of urban areas
	on the streamflows appears to be important at the local scale but
	not very marked at the basin scale, but their impact on the energy
	budget is strong. Moreover, it is shown that the aquifers play a
	very important role. The underground contribution to the discharge
	reaches more than 80% of the Seine river flow in summertime and similar
	to 40% in winter. Even during the wintertime floods, the aquifers
	play a crucial role, since the larger part of the drainage is stored
	in the water tables, which significantly reduces the intensity of
	the floods and, thus, of their consequences. It is finally shown
	that the ability of SIM to reproduce the evolution of the aquifers
	and the partition between surface runoff and drainage leads to a
	good simulation of the main floods of the Seine.},

  abstract = {To quantify carbon and water fluxes between the vegetation and the
	atmosphere in a consistent manner, land surface models now include
	interactive vegetation components. These models treat the vegetation
	biomass as a prognostic model state, allowing the model to dynamically
	adapt the vegetation states to environmental conditions. However,
	it is expected that the prediction skill of such models can be greatly
	increased by assimilating biophysical observations such as leaf area
	index (LAI). The Jacobian of the observation operator, a central
	aspect of data assimilation methods such as the extended Kalman filter
	(EKF) and the variational assimilation methods, provides the required
	linear relationship between the observation and the model states.
	In this paper, the Jacobian required for assimilating LAI into the
	Interaction between the Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere-A-gs land
	surface model using the EKF is studied. In particular, sensitivity
	experiments were undertaken on the size of the initial perturbation
	for estimating the Jacobian and on the length of the time window
	between initial state and available observation. It was found that
	small perturbations (0.1% of the state) typically lead to accurate
	estimates of the Jacobian. While other studies have shown that the
	assimilation of LAI with 10 day assimilation windows is possible,
	1 day assimilation intervals can be chosen to comply with numerical
	weather prediction requirements. Moreover, the seasonal dependence
	of the Jacobian revealed contrasted groups of Jacobian values due
	to environmental factors. Further analyses showed the Jacobian values
	to vary as a function of the LAI itself, which has important implications
	for its assimilation in different seasons, as the size of the LAI
	increments will subsequently vary due to the variability of the Jacobian.},

	In particular, the accurate description of those surface variables

	is applied to observed surface soil moisture and LAI observations
	Of the SMOSREX site near Toulouse, in south-western France, from
	2001 to 2004. This period includes severe droughts in 2003 and 2004.
	The data are jointly assimilated into ISBA-A-g(s) in order to analyse
	the root-zone soil moisture and the vegetation biomass. It is shown
	that the 1D-VAR improves the model results. The efficiency score

  abstract = {[1] The CarboEurope Regional Experiment Strategy (CERES) experiment
	took place in May and June 2005 in France and offers a comprehensive
	database on atmospheric CO2 and boundary layer processes at the regional
	scale. One "golden'' day of CERES is interpreted with the mesoscale
	atmospheric model Meso-NH coupled on-line with the Interactions between
	Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere, CO2-reactive (ISBA-A-gs) surface
	scheme, allowing a full interaction of CO2 between the surface and
	the atmosphere. The rapid diurnal cycle of carbon coupled with water
	and energy fluxes is parameterized including, e. g., plant assimilation,
	respiration, anthropogenic emissions, and sea fluxes. During the
	analyzed day, frequent vertical profiles and aircraft transects revealed
	high spatial and temporal variabilities of CO2 concentrations within
	the boundary layer at the regional scale: a 10-ppm gradient of CO2-mixing
	ratio is observed during the day by the aircraft measurements. The
	Meso-NH model proved able to simulate very well the CO2 concentration
	variability as well as the spatial and temporal evolution of the
	surface fluxes and the boundary layer in the domain. The model is
	used to explain the CO2 variability as a result of two complementary
	processes: ( 1) the regional heterogeneity of CO2 surface fluxes
	related to the land cover ( e. g., winter crops versus a pine forest)
	and ( 2) the variability of mesoscale circulation across the boundary
	layer: development of the sea breeze in the western part of the domain
	and dominating wind flow in the eastern part of the domain.},

  abstract = {Saltation is the wind-driven, hopping motion of sand-sized particles
	across an erodible surface. This mode of motion not only transports
	sand and similar materials in its own right but can also initiate
	(through bombardment of the surface) the entrainment and subsequent
	transport by suspension of smaller dust particles. In this paper,
	we report a wind tunnel study of the effect of saltation bombardment
	on dust entrainment. The technique is to allow sand grains to saltate
	from an upwind sand source onto a bed of dust particles. The experiment
	confirms that the ejection of dust particles by saltation bombardment
	(as opposed to detachment of dust particles by aerodynamic forces)
	is the principal mechanism for the natural entrainment of dust by
	wind. The data are used to examine the dependence of the dust emission
	flux F d (mass per unit ground area per unit time) upon the friction
	velocity u *; it is found that F d is closely proportional to the
	streamwise flux of saltating sand grains, which in turn is approximately
	proportional to u * 3 At a given u *, F d increases as the size of
	the bombarding sand grains increases. On the basis of the hypothesis
	that F d is proportional to the kinetic energy flux of the saltating
	sand grains, we derive theoretically the result that Fd scales with
	the streamwise saltating sand grain flux and thence approximately
	with u * 3, as observed in this experiment.},

	by 18 yr of observed meteorological data from a grassland catchment
	at Valdai. Russia, as part of the Project for the Intercomparison
	of Land-Surface Parameterization Schemes (PILPS) Phase 2(d). In this
	paper the authors examine the simulation of snow. In comparison with
	observations, the models are able to capture the broad features of
	the snow regime on both an intra- and interannual basis. However,
	weaknesses in the simulations exist, and early season ablation events
	are a significant source of model scatter. Over the 18-yr simulation,
	systematic differences between the models' snow simulations are evident
	and reveal specific aspects of snow model parameterization and design
	as being responsible. Vapor exchange at the snow surface varies widely
	among the models, ranging from a large net loss to a small net source
	for the snow season. Snow albedo, fractional snow cover, and their
	interplay have a large effect on energy available for ablation, with
	differences among models most evident at low snow depths. The incorporation
	of the snowpack within an LSS structure affects the method by which
	snow accesses, as well as utilizes, available energy for ablation.
	The sensitivity of some models to longwave radiation, the dominant
	winter radiative flux, is partly due to a stability-induced feedback
	and the differing abilities of models to exchange turbulent energy
	with the atmosphere. Results presented in this paper suggest where
	weaknesses in macroscale snow modeling lie and where both theoretical
	and observational work should he focused to address these weaknesses.},

  abstract = {Lakes can influence regional climate, yet most general circulation
	models have, at best, simple and largely untested representations
	of lakes. We developed the Lake, Ice, Snow, and Sediment Simulator
	(LISSS) for inclusion in the land-surface component (CLM4) of an
	earth system model (CESM1). The existing CLM4 lake model performed
	poorly at all sites tested; for temperate lakes, summer surface water
	temperature predictions were 10&#8211;25°C lower than observations.
	CLM4-LISSS modifies the existing model by including (1) a treatment
	of snow; (2) freezing, melting, and ice physics; (3) a sediment thermal
	submodel; (4) spatially variable prescribed lake depth; (5) improved
	parameterizations of lake surface properties; (6) increased mixing
	under ice and in deep lakes; and (7) correction of previous errors.
	We evaluated the lake model predictions of water temperature and
	surface fluxes at three small temperate and boreal lakes where extensive
	observational data was available. We also evaluated the predicted
	water temperature and/or ice and snow thicknesses for ten other lakes
	where less comprehensive forcing observations were available. CLM4-LISSS
	performed very well compared to observations for shallow to medium-depth
	small lakes. For large, deep lakes, the under-prediction of mixing
	was improved by increasing the lake eddy diffusivity by a factor
	of 10, consistent with previous published analyses. Surface temperature
	and surface flux predictions were improved when the aerodynamic roughness
	lengths were calculated as a function of friction velocity, rather
	than using a constant value of 1 mm or greater. We evaluated the
	sensitivity of surface energy fluxes to modeled lake processes and
	parameters. Large changes in monthly-averaged surface fluxes (up
	to 30 W m&#8722;2) were found when excluding snow insulation or phase
	change physics and when varying the opacity, depth, albedo of melting
	lake ice, and mixing strength across ranges commonly found in real
	lakes. Typical variation among model parameterization choices can
	therefore cause persistent local surface flux changes much larger
	than expected changes in greenhouse forcing. We conclude that CLM4-LISSS
	adequately simulates lake water temperature and surface energy fluxes,
	with errors comparable in magnitude to those resulting from uncertainty
	in global lake properties, and is suitable for inclusion in global
	and regional climate studies.},

  abstract = {Classical aerosol schemes use either a sectional (bin) or lognormal
	approach. Both approaches have particular capabilities and interests:
	the sectional approach is able to describe every kind of distribution,
	whereas the lognormal one makes assumption of the distribution form
	with a fewer number of explicit variables. For this last reason we
	developed a three-moment lognormal aerosol scheme named ORILAM to
	be coupled in three-dimensional mesoscale or CTM models. This paper
	presents the concept and hypothesis of a range of aerosol processes
	such as nucleation, coagulation, condensation, sedimentation, and
	dry deposition. One particular interest of ORILAM is to keep explicit
	the aerosol composition and distribution (mass of each constituent,
	mean radius, and standard deviation of the distribution are explicit)
	using the prediction of three-moment (m0, m3, and m6). The new model
	was evaluated by comparing simulations to measurements from the Escompte
	campaign and to a previously published aerosol model. The numerical
	cost of the lognormal mode is lower than two bins of the sectional
	one.},

	of the model is made that covers in particular the on-line coupling
	capability for calculating meteorological and chemical concentration

  abstract = {Several studies have shown the importance of desert dust aerosols
	in weather forecast models. Nevertheless, desert dust has been poorly
	represented in such models and is the source of some prediction errors,
	in particular for tropical and subtropical regions. The purpose of
	this paper is to illustrate the formation and the three-dimensional
	transport of a severe dust storm which occurred in March 2006 over
	West Africa. An intense dust haze was transported southward over
	the Gulf of Guinea thereby generating an aerosol optical thickness
	(AOT) greater than 4 over Nigeria. The MesoNH mesoscale atmospheric
	model coupled with new dust parameterization schemes has been used
	to illustrate the three-dimensional transport of the dust plume and
	the vertical layering of this desert air mass above the lower atmosphere
	monsoon flux layer. It is modeled that more than 50 g m(-2) of dust
	was emitted during this event from the surface by a strong Harmattan
	wind over the Sahel region. It is also shown that when the dust layer
	is located over the boundary layer, it can modify the atmospheric
	stability by as much as 9.5 K in terms of potential temperature in
	the lowest 2000 m of the atmosphere.},

	data sets as regards the prediction of particle size distributions,
	the wind speed dependence of sea-salt aerosol mass concentrations,
	and the evolution of sea spray aerosol plumes generated over the
	surf zone. The model was applied to study effects of sea spray aerosol
	produced in the surf zone on sea spray concentrations, the composition
	of continental/sea spray aerosol mixture, the uptake of nitric acid
	by sea spray aerosol, and the effect of the latter process on nitric
	acid profiles. The results lead to the conclusion that surf-produced

	basins in the Southern Great Plains region of the United States.
	Forcing data (precipitation, incoming radiation and surface meteorology)
	and land-surface characteristics (soil and vegetation parameters)
	were provided to each of the participating schemes. Two groups of
	runs are presented. (1) Calibration-validation runs, using data from
	six small catchments distributed across the modeling domain. These
	runs were designed to test the ability of the schemes to transfer
	information about model parameters to other catchments and to the
	computational grid boxes. (2) Base-runs, using data for 1979-1988,
	designed to evaluate the ability of the schemes to reproduce measured
	energy and water fluxes over multiple seasonal cycles across a climatically
	diverse, continental-scale basin. All schemes completed the base-runs
	but five schemes chose not to calibrate. Observational data (from
	1980-1986) including daily river flows and monthly basin total evaporation
	estimated through an atmospheric budget analysis, were used to evaluate
	model performance. In general, the results are consistent with earlier
	PILPS experiments in terms of differences among models in predicted
	water and energy fluxes. The mean annual net radiation varied between
	80 and 105 W m(-2) (excluding one model). The mean annual Bowen ratio
	varied from 0.52 to 1.73 (also excluding one model) as compared to
	the data-estimated value of 0.92. The run-off ratios varied from
	a low of 0.02 to a high of 0.41, as compared to an observed value
	of 0.15. In general, those schemes that did not calibrate performed
	worse, not only on the validation catchments, but also at the scale
	of the entire modeling domain. This suggests that further PILPS experiments
	on the value of calibration need to be carried out. (C) 1998 Elsevier

  abstract = {Most of the existing generation of general circulation models (GCMs)
	use so-called bucket algorithms to represent land-surface hydrology.
	Biosphere-atmosphere models that include the transfer of energy,
	mass, and momentum between the atmosphere and the land surface are
	a recent alternative to this highly simplified representation of
	the land surface in GCMs. These models require estimation of a large
	number of parameters for which parameter estimation methods and supporting
	data remain to be developed. We describe a more incremental approach
	to generalizing the bucket representation of land-surface hydrology
	based on a model that represents the variation in infiltration capacity
	within a GCM grid cell. The variable infiltration capacity (VIC)
	model requires estimation of three parameters: an infiltration parameter,
	an evaporation parameter, and a base flow recession coefficient.
	The VIC model was explored through direct comparisons with the Geophysical
	Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) bucket model for the French Broad
	River, North Carolina, and via sensitivity analysis for the GFDL
	R30 grid cell which contains the French Broad River. Generally, the
	bucket model runoff had much greater variability than the historic
	streamflows for short time scales (e.g., 1 day); the VIC model was
	much more similar to the observed flows in this respect. The results
	also showed that the bucket model tended to have unrealistically
	high short-term variability. The sensitivity analysis showed that
	the base flow parameter exerted the greatest influence on both the
	mean and variability of most of the hydrologic variables, especially
	winter runoff, summer evaporation, and summer and winter soil moisture.},
